# Memory-Game



## Instructions

When the game starts, all cards are turned face down. The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. If the two card have the same icon, they remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over after a short period of time.

The goal of the game is to get all the cards flipped face-up in the least number of tries. That means that a lower number of attempts scores better.
